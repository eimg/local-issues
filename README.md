# Acme Issues

A small, self-contained issue and local pull-request manager. Issues, Git-backed PR identities, SHA-bound review history, findings, and checks live in SQLite.

Pairs naturally with [Helix](https://github.com/eimg/helix) for local agent-driven workflows — no GitHub account required.

## Acme development testbed

Acme Issues is one of four related projects. They remain separate products with separate responsibilities.

| Project | Role |
|---|---|
| **[Primer](https://github.com/eimg/primer)** | Knowledge product and fictional Acme evidence corpus; not currently part of the runtime loop. |
| **[Helix](https://github.com/eimg/helix)** | Agent workflow control plane that receives work and orchestrates changes. |
| **[Acme Issues](https://github.com/eimg/acme-issues)** | Local issue and PR management surface that triggers Helix and receives callbacks. |
| **[Acme Todo](https://github.com/eimg/acme-todo)** | Disposable target application used for agent implementation and verification. |

Typical exercise: Acme Issues sends a work item to Helix, which works on Acme Todo. Primer develops the separate knowledge and retrieval side of the same fictional Acme context.

## Companion project: [Helix](https://github.com/eimg/helix)

This tracker is built to pair with **[Helix](https://github.com/eimg/helix)** — an agent control plane that runs implementation specialists and an independent local PR-review workflow.

| Project | Role |
|---------|------|
| **acme-issues** (this repo) | Human-facing issue and local PR management; stores review evidence and merge records |
| **[Helix](https://github.com/eimg/helix)** | Implements issues, then independently reviews exact PR head SHAs |

  └──── exact-SHA evidence callback ◄──── Helix reviewer + verifier
```

No GitHub account or `gh` CLI required for this loop.

## Pull request review lifecycle

Acme Issues is the durable human-facing side of the review boundary:

1. A trusted producer registers a Git-backed PR with its repository path, base branch/SHA, head branch/SHA, author, origin, and optional linked issue. Helix normally supplies this after a successful implementation run.
2. A human requests review. Acme Issues sends the immutable PR identity and an idempotent callback identity to Helix’s independent `/pr-reviews` workflow.
3. Helix runs its reviewer and verifier against that exact head SHA, then returns lifecycle events, findings, executed checks, summary, and one of `ready_to_merge`, `changes_requested`, or `blocked`.
4. Acme Issues stores every review revision, but applies a decision to the current PR only when the returned head SHA still matches. Changing the head resets readiness to `draft`; older evidence remains visible as history.
5. `ready_to_merge` does not merge Git. A human merges the reviewed head, then records the result with **Mark merged**, which closes the linked issue.

This boundary lets the same review workflow accept Helix-created PRs and PRs registered by another trusted producer without making GitHub a dependency. Registered repositories and their verification commands are currently assumed trusted; the local harness is not a sandbox for hostile contributions.

## Requirements

- Node.js ≥ 20

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/eimg/acme-issues.git
cd acme-issues
npm install
npm run build    # optional; dev mode compiles on the fly
npm link         # optional; exposes `acme-issues` CLI
```

## Getting started

### Standalone (tracker only)

```bash
npm run dev
# → http://127.0.0.1:8320/
```

Open **Settings** to set your webhook URL and label filter, then create issues from the UI or API.

### Recommended: Helix integration

Run both services side by side.

**Terminal 1 — Helix on your target repo**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/eimg/helix.git
cd helix && npm install && npm run build && npm link

cd your-project
helix init --preset typescript
cp .env.example .env   # set OPENROUTER_API_KEY + HELIX_MODEL
helix serve
# → http://127.0.0.1:8319/
```

**Terminal 2 — acme-issues**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/eimg/acme-issues.git
cd acme-issues && npm install
npm run dev
# → http://127.0.0.1:8320/
```

**Configure Settings** (`http://127.0.0.1:8320/`):

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Webhook URL | `http://127.0.0.1:8319/runs` |
| Label filter | `trigger` (default) |
| Continuation comment command | `/helix` (default) |
| Webhooks enabled | on |

Create an open issue with the `trigger` label (or add the label to an existing issue). Acme Issues delivers a webhook and Helix starts an implementation run. When the Dev leaves a clean committed feature branch, Helix registers it here as a draft local PR. The linked issue remains **in progress**.

Open the **Pull requests** view to inspect the repository, branches, exact base/head SHAs, diff, review evidence, and history. Request review to run Helix’s independent reviewer and verifier concurrently. Only a structured decision for the current head SHA can set `ready_to_merge`; a head update resets the PR to `draft` and makes older callbacks stale.

Helix never performs the merge. After a human merges the reviewed head into the base branch, **Mark merged** records that result and closes the linked issue.

The UI intentionally does not create pull requests or select repositories.
Helix supplies the repository, branch, and exact SHA identity when it registers
completed implementation work. The registration API retains the same generic
contract so another trusted producer can integrate later without changing the
review lifecycle.

The current localhost harness assumes registered repositories and branches are trusted. Diff reading and Helix verification operate on local paths, and verification is not container-sandboxed yet.

After completion, reopen the issue or add a comment such as `/helix also cover the regression case`. The tracker uses the latest completed Helix run recorded from callbacks and sends a linked continuation request. Ordinary comments do not trigger Helix.

Full Helix setup and config: [github.com/eimg/helix](https://github.com/eimg/helix#getting-started).

## Default configuration

| Setting | Default |
|---------|---------|
| Port | `8320` |
| Webhook URL | *(empty — configure in Settings)* |
| Label filter | `trigger` |
| Continuation comment command | `/helix` |
| Webhooks enabled | `false` |
| Data directory | `./data/` (override with `ACME_ISSUES_DATA_DIR`) |

## Webhook behavior

When webhooks are enabled and a URL is set, delivery fires on:

1. **Issue created** — open issue includes the label filter
2. **Label added** — filter label added to an open issue
3. **Issue reopened** — if a completed Helix run is known, continue it; otherwise start an initial run
4. **Command comment** — a user comment beginning with the configured command continues the latest completed run
5. **Manual** — **Send webhook** button or `POST /api/issues/:id/trigger`

Outbound payload (includes correlation for Helix callbacks):

```json
{
  "title": "Fix login",
  "body": "Empty password returns 500",
  "labels": ["trigger", "bug"],
  "external": {
    "trackerUrl": "http://127.0.0.1:8320",
    "issueId": 7
  }
}
```

Headers: `X-Issues-Issue-Id`, `X-Issues-Source`, `X-Issues-Reason`.

Issue deliveries retry up to 3 times and appear in **Webhook deliveries**. PR review requests are sent directly to the Helix `/pr-reviews` endpoint derived from the configured `/runs` URL.

## Helix callbacks (inbound)

Helix can notify this tracker as a run progresses. Endpoint: `POST /api/webhooks/helix`

**`run.completed`** (sent by Helix today when a run finishes):

```
POST /api/webhooks/helix
X-Helix-Event: run.completed

{
  "event": "run.completed",
  "run": { "id": "...", "status": "done", "startedAt": ..., "finishedAt": ... },
  "issue": { "id": 7, "title": "Fix login" }
}
```

→ issue status `closed` when there is no active local PR; otherwise it remains `in_progress` awaiting review and human merge

The callback may include `parentRunId` and `rootRunId`. acme-issues stores this lineage and uses the newest completed run when it delivers a reopen or command-comment continuation.

**`run.started`** (supported by this tracker; Helix does not send it yet):

```
POST /api/webhooks/helix
X-Helix-Event: run.started

{
  "event": "run.started",
  "run": { "id": "...", "status": "running", "startedAt": ... },
  "issue": { "id": 7, "title": "Fix login" }
}
```

→ issue status `in_progress` + Helix comment

Callbacks use no auth — intended for local development.

### Local PR review callbacks

Helix sends `pr.review.started` and `pr.review.completed` to the same callback endpoint. Every result carries the reviewed `headSha`. Acme Issues stores all review revisions but updates current PR readiness only when that SHA still matches:

```json
{
  "event": "pr.review.completed",
  "review": {
    "id": "...",
    "status": "completed",
    "headSha": "abc123...",
    "decision": "ready_to_merge",
    "summary": "Reviewer and verifier passed.",
    "findings": [],
    "checks": [
      { "name": "npm test", "status": "passed", "summary": "Passed." }
    ]
  },
  "pullRequest": { "id": 4 }
}
```
